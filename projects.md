# Projects
Through this series of projects
explore how digital culture and fabrication
are changing the nature of authorship
and production.
Write scripts that write poems
and then give your poems physical form.
Collect, manage, and curate your work
in an online repository with version control.

## Poetry Repository
Develop a GitHub repository with
a Markdown manifesto or artist's statement,
Python scripts for generating poetry,
Rhino 3D model, 3D renderings,
and g-code for CNC milling.
Write your manifesto or artist's statement in your README.md file.
It should describe your ideas for your poetry generator and the resulting poems.
Write about what you would like to achieve, your inspirations, your approach,
and what you would like to try next. Consider including snippets of code and
some of the best or worst poems your poetry generator has produced.
Create this repository in the
[Digital Culture Seminar](https://github.com/digital-culture-seminar)
organization.

## Poetry Generator
Develop a Python script that generates poetry.
Have fun and express yourself as a meta-author!

## Poetry Model
Capture a series of waveforms from your poems,
generate a 3D model from the waveforms,
and cut the model into slices for digital fabrication.
Laser-cut the slices to build a small prototype
of your physical poem.

## Poetry Fabrication
CNC mill the slices out of sheets of birch plywood
and then assemble and bond the slices
to build your physical poem.
Setup an exhibition showcasing your algorithmic poetry.
