# Digital culture seminar

<p align="center"><img src="images/parametric_bench/parametric_bench_1.png"></p>

**Digital Culture Seminar**
This course will explore
how digital culture and fabrication
are changing the nature of authorship
and production in art and design.
In seminars we will discuss
cultural, technological, theoretical and ethical changes -
focusing on polyvalent authorship -
and in workshops you will experiment
with digital methods
including programming, 3D modeling, robotics,
and computer numerical controlled (CNC) machining.
You will put theory into practice
by writing scripts that write poems
and using digital fabrication
to give your poems physical form.
You will collect your work
in an online repository with version control
and present it at a exhibition
in the College of Art and Design.

**Objectives**
* Programming for artists and designers
* Theories of digital culture, design, production, and ethics.
* Polyvalent authorship in the digital age
